                    <p>New York City is made up of five boroughs which include Queens, Manhattan, Brooklyn, the Bronx, and Staten Island. 
                        The city is the home of approximately 8 million people. In 1876, France gifted the City of 
                        New York what is known as the Statue of Liberty,  which is currently located on Liberty Island and commonly visited by tourists. 
                        However, it took 10 years to assemble and therefore wasn't unveiled until 1886. 
                        Another tourist destination is Times Square. Times Square is commonly known for the big buildings, Broadway shows, 
                        and bright neon signs. This famous location was named after The New York Times after the Times moved to that location. 
                        Prior to that, it was named Longacre Square. New York City is also known for its bridges that connect the boroughs 
                        and allow ease of transportation.</p>
